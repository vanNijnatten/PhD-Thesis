1.	(Very) Severe COPD is transcriptionally unique compared to mild and moderate COPD and not just a progression of disease."

2.	"Cellular deconvolution approaches can contribute to our understanding of both cell-type-dependent and independent gene expression alterations in COPD."

3.	"Changes in DNA methylation in a gene does not equal changes in gene expression."

4.	"The impact of DNA methylation on gene expression can only be investigated properly by using matched samples and follow-up functional studies in the lab."

5.	Multi-omics studies in COPD patients without adequate (clinical) characterization will only lead to findings with limited clinical translation.

6.	"MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression and MiR-331-3p regulates ECM homeostasis and lung tissue remodelling in SEO-COPD"

7.	"Manuscripts on COPD that only included never smoking controls are not looking at COPD but just the effects of smoking."

8.	"Bioinformatical code and analyses should be checked using code reviews and (unit) tests, not just by looking at expected results."

9.	"Writing is essential for thinking and a requirement for research, but we should also write for the general public, not just our peers."

10.	"We should attempt to structure our raw data as well as research output in a way that is future proof for the 'age of AI'."
